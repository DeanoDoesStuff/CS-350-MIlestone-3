# CS-350-MIlestone-3

This project aimed to create a state machine for processing and displaying Morse code messages. 

I felt that my process for debugging worked well.

My biggest weakness with this project was the initial wiring of the new switches. I made a mistake early in the process and paid dearly for it later in confusion and frustration. But I got it working in the end.

Youtube is a great place to start for content that helps build a greater understanding of the concepts covered in this class.

As for skills from this course brought over into other projects? More programming practice always helps of course. However, in my projects I think this course has given me resources and direction as to what I can build for my employer in the manufacturing space.

My project was made maintanable and readable by writing in line comments where needed. Context matters, and if there could be a somewhat confusing function or statement, a comments helps to clear that up. Since the source code just had TODOS that needed written into, I didn't create any new functions, as that wasn't necessary.
